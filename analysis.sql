-- convert NDVI to geometry ST_Polygon(maybe)

-- something about elevation, selected vegetation that is a above a certain elevation for canopy(?)

-- Select the CO Index over the parks/vegetated areas
-- clip co index rast to the parks veg areas
-- calculate the mean over that area

-- Select the aerosol index over the parks/vegetated areas
-- clip aerosol index rast to the parks veg areas
-- calculate the mean over that area



----------
-- do the inverse, so get average for non- veg areas


--Do the same for Each neighborhood â€“ see how those areas compare to pre/during/post values 


-- some sort of raster subtraction to ID areas of highest recovery/ most difference (ie. post - durring, pre- durring etc )
