-- Select the CO Index over the parks/vegetated areas
-- clip co index rast to the parks veg areas
-- calculate the mean over that area

-- Select the aerosol index over the parks/vegetated areas
-- clip aerosol index rast to the parks veg areas
-- calculate the mean over that area



----------
-- do the inverse, so get average for non- veg areas

-- Select the CO Index over the NON parks/vegetated areas
-- clip co index rast to the non parks veg areas
-- calculate the mean over that area

-- Select the aerosol index over the non parks/vegetated areas will this require converting raster to vector?
-- clip aerosol index rast to the non parks veg areas
-- calculate the mean over that area



-- find the average income for each neighborhood (social vuln and )

--Do the same for Each neighborhood â€“ see how those areas compare to pre/during/post values 



-- some sort of raster subtraction to ID areas of highest recovery/ most difference (ie. post - durring, pre- durring etc )
